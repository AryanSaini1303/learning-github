==>git log:provides the log of all the commits 
==>git status:provides any pending commits or files which are not added
==>git init:initialises a local repositry
==>git add *:adds all the files to staging area
==>git commit -m "message":commits the staged changes with message
==>git diff filename:shows the unstaged changes which we have done in the file
==>git checkout filename:"removes" the unstaged changes from working directory

==>first we initialise a repo locally in a working directory
==>then we stage all the changes to the file/add file to the staging area using git "add *"
==>then we use git commit -m "message" to commit all the files/changes to the local repositry
==>we can then create a remote repositry on the github and link the local repositry with remote repositry
==>use the command "git remote add origin https://github.com/AryanSaini1303/learning-github.git" to create a remote for the repositry, the link we used is the https link of the remote repositry
==>then use "git branch -M main" to select the main branch
==>then at last we use "git push -u origin main" to push the changes/files to the main branch in the remote repositry
==>we can have both local and remote repositry and we can push the files from local to remote repositry
==>our local repositry is in the .git file in the working directory which is hidden and the remote reposity is on the github
==>we can use create a ".gitignore" file and we can write the file name in the ".gitignore" file so that those files stay hidden in the remote repositry at the github
==>we can use "git clone https://github.com/AryanSaini1303/Portfolio.git" to clone a remote repositry to your local repositry, a new folder is created and all the files are stored in the that folder
==>now we can modify that local repositry and can also push it to the current remote repositry
